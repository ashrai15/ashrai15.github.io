# Senior Seminar Project
As a senior at Union University, I am aiming to create an interactive map of my school's campus to aid visitors and students in finding their way around campus.

## Goals:
- [ ] Find a suitable API for wifi triangulation
- [ ] Create a web app that utilizes this API
- [ ] Make a version for visitors that is directions-only
- [ ] Make a version for students that utilizes their school login to access schedules, room numbers, etc.
